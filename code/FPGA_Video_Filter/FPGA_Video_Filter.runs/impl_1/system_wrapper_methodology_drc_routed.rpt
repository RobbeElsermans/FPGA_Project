TIMING-1#1 Warning
Invalid clock waveform on Clock Modifying Block  
Invalid clock waveform for clock pixel_dynclk specified at a BUFR output system_i/video_dynclk/U0/BUFR_inst/O that does not match the CMB settings. The waveform of the clock is 6.734 {0 3.367}. The expected waveform is 8.335 {0 3.334}

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 1.885 ns between dphy_data_hs_p[0] (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) and system_i/MIPI_D_PHY_RX_0/U0/DataLaneGen[0].DPHY_LaneSFEN_X/HSDeserializerX/Deserializer/DDLY (clocked by dphy_hs_clock_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.038 ns.
