# Research

before I could begin on this project, I had to make sure that I had the right components at my disposal. Like the given tutorial said I needed a

* Zybo Z7-20 board
* External 5V supply
* Micro-USB cable
* 1 HDMI Type A to Type A or HDMI Type A to DVI-D cable
* 1 Pcam 5C assembly
* HDMI or DVI monitor

At the time of writing this, I was going to school so the school provided me the hardware needed for this task. 

As I read the tutorial that was given, I noticied that the progam itself was written in Vivado Design Suite & Xilinx SDK 2016.4. I suppose a lot has changed in the past 4 years. To test the tutorial I'm going t use the version 2016.4. In the future I could try this in verion 20.2. 

I expect no dificulties to setting up this tutorial. However in my experience this happends rarely.

## Update
In the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Digilent/Zybo-Z7-20-pcam-5c) we can see that there is a version for Vivado 2019.1 available. We're going to test that one out in the future.
